# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This codebase is a collection of Python scripts located in the `HelloWorld/` directory. Each file demonstrates a specific Python concept or feature, such as data types, operators, functions, and control flow. The project is educational and modular, with each file serving as a standalone example.

## Directory Structure
- `HelloWorld/`
  - `app.py`: Entry point or main script (if present)
  - `bool.py`: Boolean operations and logic
  - `conditStatements.py`: Conditional statements (if/else)
  - `data_types.py`: Data types (int, float, str, etc.)
  - `functions.py`: Function definitions and usage
  - `lists.py`: List operations
  - `multiline.py`: Multiline statements or strings
  - `operators.py`: Arithmetic and logical operators
  - `strings.py`: String manipulation
  - `strmodif.py`: String modification examples
  - `tuples.py`: Tuple usage and operations

## Key Patterns and Conventions
- Each file is focused on a single Python concept; avoid cross-file dependencies.
- No external dependencies or package management detected; all scripts use standard Python libraries.
- Naming conventions are descriptive and match the concept being demonstrated.
- No test files or build scripts found; scripts are run directly with Python.
- No class-based architecture; all code is procedural and example-driven.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run any script:**
  ```powershell
  python HelloWorld/<filename>.py
  ```
  Example: `python HelloWorld/data_types.py`
- **Debugging:**
  Use print statements or Python debugger (`pdb`) directly in the script.
- **No build or test commands required.**

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, databases, or services are integrated.
- No configuration files or environment variables required.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- Focus on clarity and simplicity; each file should remain self-contained.
- When adding new examples, follow the existing naming and structural conventions.
- If introducing new concepts, create a new file in `HelloWorld/` with a descriptive name.
- Avoid introducing external dependencies unless explicitly requested.

## Example: Adding a New Concept
To add an example for Python dictionaries:
- Create `HelloWorld/dictionaries.py` with clear, commented code demonstrating dictionary usage.
